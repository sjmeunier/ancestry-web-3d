# ancestry-web-3d
A 3D family tree representation using Unity to show the interconnectedness of your ancestors.

The app reads GEDCOM files and uses this data as the bases for the tree. The user is able to select the root person, as well as the number of generations to include. The data is then rendered as a tree.

The rendering places each generation back as a circle of individuals, connecting individuals by line of descent. 

Navigation is done with a combination of mouse and keyboard. The view can be rotated by dragging the mouse while left clicking, and panning by right clicking and dragging. Zooming can be done with the middle scroll button. Moving forwards and backwards and left and right can be done with arrow keys as well.

The escape key brings up the settings menu.
